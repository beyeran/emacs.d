2010/4/8 1.2

  * add "A" keybinding for darcsum-amend
    darcsum-amend can only amend the most recent patch right now

  * show non-ascii characters unescaped by default
    Note, changes with non-ascii characters are still ignored.

  * always record with --no-test, for greater reliability
    Darcs repo test commands are too diverse and unpredictable for darcsum
    to deal with, so just always use --no-test. This is compatible with
    darcs >= 2.0 and hopefully darcs 1.x as well.

  * ignore a pending setpref rather than failing

  * add support for debugging darcs interaction controlled by darcsum-debug flag
