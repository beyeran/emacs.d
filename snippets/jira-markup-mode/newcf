New/Updated canonicals for {{$1}}:

{code:java}

provide other values without CanoForm if those makes sense in your language.

Add a matrix in your languages sub-task providing the list of values we used for
{{$1}}.

We can't use our trusty {{cf_testing_*}} tests, since they rely on UIMA for their creation. Hence, no {{cf_testing_}}.
